\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf sharp\+Advising.\+Course} \\*\doxyref{Course}{p.}{classsharp_advising_1_1_course}\+: Stores and pulls information about individual courses for the forseable future. Usability\+: Create a course with the constructor accepting a string refering to the number\+I\+D of the course to pull information for and a string refering to the department I\+D of the course to pull information for It owns a list of \doxyref{Term}{p.}{classsharp_advising_1_1_term} objects which each term (i.\+e. Fall, Winter etc...) owns a list of sections that contain specific information about the courses different oferring times. Once this object is created you can navigate through its list of \doxyref{Term}{p.}{classsharp_advising_1_1_term} objects \char`\"{}owned\+Terms\char`\"{} and through \char`\"{}owned\+Terms\char`\"{} list of \doxyref{Section}{p.}{classsharp_advising_1_1_section} objects \char`\"{}owned\+Sections\char`\"{} to compare the times that offered between different courses. }{\pageref{classsharp_advising_1_1_course}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf sharp\+Advising.\+Course\+Stack} \\*\doxyref{Course\+Stack}{p.}{classsharp_advising_1_1_course_stack} temporary garbage code I was playing with but contains a function I dont want to delete yet }{\pageref{classsharp_advising_1_1_course_stack}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf sharp\+Advising.\+Course\+Stack\+Node} }{\pageref{classsharp_advising_1_1_course_stack_node}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf sharp\+Advising.\+Match} \\*\doxyref{Match}{p.}{classsharp_advising_1_1_match} simply holds the department id and number id for a course this will most likely be used for output }{\pageref{classsharp_advising_1_1_match}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf sharp\+Advising.\+Pre\+Req} \\*This is the module currently being worked on and needs to build an object made up of courses that a student is qualified for }{\pageref{classsharp_advising_1_1_pre_req}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf sharp\+Advising.\+Program} }{\pageref{classsharp_advising_1_1_program}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf sharp\+Advising.\+Quarter} }{\pageref{classsharp_advising_1_1_quarter}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf sharp\+Advising.\+Section} \\*}{\pageref{classsharp_advising_1_1_section}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf sharp\+Advising.\+Term} \\*\doxyref{Term}{p.}{classsharp_advising_1_1_term} serves to allow for information in courses to be organized more efficently it contains a list of owned\+Sections }{\pageref{classsharp_advising_1_1_term}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf sharp\+Advising.\+Time\+Filter} \\*T\+O\+D\+O\+: Update the time filter to deal with students not starting in quarter 0, If time allows should also be updated to include options to take x number of courses }{\pageref{classsharp_advising_1_1_time_filter}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf sharp\+Advising.\+Times} }{\pageref{classsharp_advising_1_1_times}}{}
