Usability\+: Create a course with the constructor accepting a string refering to the number\+I\+D of the course to pull information for and a string refering to the department I\+D of the course to pull information for It owns a list of \doxyref{Term}{p.}{classsharp_advising_1_1_term} objects which each term (i.\+e. Fall, Winter etc...) owns a list of sections that contain specific information about the courses different oferring times.
